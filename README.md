# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

This app is aimed at educators who are seeking support or wanting to share experiences. It is meant to help create a sense of community and support for a profession that has suffered a lot during Covid, and where we see many teachers quit.

## Sign-Up / Sign-In pages

All the content of this website is restricted to signed-up users, and password protected. On the sign up page, users are required to enter a Username, Password (and password confirmation), and how many years of experience they have. The rest of the input are just interesting as far as knowing which State the educator is from , since the State standards are different, their area of expertise...

## Home Page

The home page give statistics and some background regarding the state of education today. Sources are shared on the page itself, and offer understanding for the user about the general well-being of educators in 2023.

## Categories

There are 7 categories:
-Lesson Prep
-Classroom Management
-Communication With Parents
-School Staff relationships
-First Year Teacher
-Useful Apps
-Mental Health Support

Only the admin can delete or add a category. Users will hover over the category and read its description. If they are interested in it, they then click on its title and access the category card.

# Category Cards

Here, users can access and/or add ressources about that specific category, or read/add comments about their own experience, or ask questions to the community. 

## My Categories

This is a visual, inspired of WordCloud, of which categories the user posts in the most. The more they have posted, the bigger and bolder the name is rendered - the color also changes from light to dark green. At the bottom of the page are the categories they haven't yet posted in, and a direct link to them.

## My Posts

Here are all the posts from one user. They can choose to delete, or update their posts if needed.
